I will package and ship items\/orders as soon as I possibly can once I have procured the proper shipping materials. \r\n\r\nAt this time, I can only ship larger items (boxes, bottles, wands) within the US and Canada. I can ship the necklaces and small jewelry items to some international destinations so convo me for details as to whether I can ship to your country. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO UK CUSTOMERS: Please be advised that your Royal Mail may decide to charge a Customs Handling fee. Unfortunately I have no way of knowing if this will occur or how much the fee would be. Most of my transactions have not had any such problems but recently one UK customers package was literally held hostage for both VAT and Customs Fees. I am afraid I have no way of paying these fees for you in advance when I post the package. You will have to be responsible for all fees and tariffs incurred outside the normal postage charges. Please keep this in mind before ordering.\r\n\r\nI usually try to ship within 3 days and generally attempt to send packages either first class or priority. Heavier packages may have to be shipped parcel post and will take longer to arrive. \r\n\r\nIf you require an item to arrive quickly and wish to insure the shipping be expedited to arrive by a certain date, please convo me BEFORE you purchase the item to see if such shipping options are available.

I assure you this is not so. I take great care and pride in the quality of my crafts. \r\n\r\nMy prices are low in order to allow them to sell quickly and find new, appreciative homes! I cannot possibly keep everything I craft so I need to sell the items I make to folk who will love them. I basically calculate the cost of materials used and add just a tiny bit for profit to allow me to purchase more supplies for future crafting. (I am not in business to make tons of money, nor is this my full time job. My crafting is a hobby and this shop is merely an outlet to disseminate my overflow of crafted items.) I do not charge for my time as I find the crafting process so enjoyable that I cannot justify charging customers for my having fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVES: If you are interested in purchasing an item but don&#39;t have the funds at the moment, you are welcome to convo me and arrange for a reserve to be placed on that item. I will reserve an item for you for no more than a period of one month, so if the item is not purchased within that time, it will be returned to it&#39;s open status in the shop to be available for purchase by anyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOM REQUESTS: I am no longer taking requests for custom\/special items.

A lot of the items in our shop are customized; which means we have to give our attention to each one. Once your proof is sent out, you may make unlimited changes until your order is just right. However, each round of changes takes anywhere from 1-3 business days depending on order volume. We recommend trying to give your designer as many changes as possible in your first round of proofs so that you can get your order as quick as possible. \r\n\r\nIF YOU ARE IN A RUSH: or need your order in two weeks or less, please convo us and ask about rush service and shipping. We use the design form (Do you need your item by a certain date?

It is not a guarantee that you will get your order by the date that you state on this form, unless you upgrade to a faster processing and shipping method.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDER: turn-around times may differ from regular turn-around times. Custom work can take anywhere from 4-5 business days from purchase to receive a proof. Due to the custom nature, these orders are more involved and take more time.

Show your home state pride with our ORIGINAL home t-shirt, now available in Long Sleeve! This is a hand silk screened, Canvas Tri-Blend T-Shirt with the Original, ever-so-popular &quot;home.&quot; logo screen printed on the front, creating a soft vintage feel. We use special screen-printing techniques and water-based inks that result in a super comfortable shirt that\u2019s both durable and stylish. There\u2019s no better way to show off the love of your home state! \n\nTo see all Tennessee-related items from Home State Apparel, follow this link: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/HomeStateApparel\/search?search_query=tennessee&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ref=shop_search\n\n** Please note: we do not always have the Canvas grey long-sleeves in stock. There&#39;s a chance that your grey long-sleeve might be printed on an American Apparel long-sleeve instead. Other than the brand name, there is very little difference between the two shirts. **\n\nFeatures:\n- We offer these shirts in three different colors: Light Grey, Heather Navy, and Charcoal Black. (Unfortunately, due to a shortage with the manufacturer, we no longer carry Maroon.) \n- Designed for added comfort and extreme durability, this Canvas Tri-Blend Long Sleeve T-shirt is a combination of 50% polyester, 37.5% cotton and 12.5% rayon, resulting in a super soft, silky feel.\n- To clean, machine wash warm with like colors using non-chlorine bleach. Tumble-dry low, medium iron. (Washing instructions are also printed on the label.)\n- Our \u201chome.\u201d shirts make a perfect gift for friends and family, especially during the holidays \u2013 and we\u2019re always happy to ship our products as gifts without the bill included! Just leave a note in the \u201cMessage to Seller\u201d box upon checkout dictating your unique instructions. \n\nSizing: \nThese shirts are available in Small, Medium, Large, X-Large, and XX-Large. The sizing chart featured below should assist you in making your size selections. \n\nSize\/Chest\/Waist\nSmall\/34-36 inches\/30-32 inches\nMedium\/38-40 inches\/32-33 inches\nLarge\/42-44 inches\/33-34 inches\nX-Large\/46-48 inches\/36-38 inches\nXX-Large\/50-52 inches\/40-42 inches\n\nAs with all clothing, the sizes above are approximate. If you prefer your clothes to be a little loose, consider ordering a size up. These shirts are Tri-Blend and will not shrink in the wash. \nWe offer free exchanges. If something doesn&#39;t fit or you experience a problem with the shirt, simply send us a convo and we\u2019ll provide exchange instructions. \n\nAll shirts are carefully wrapped and shipped within 3-5 days directly to your door via USPS. Once your item has shipped, you will receive an automated email with a USPS tracking number.
