"title": "1960 Elvis Presley Original Movie Still - Flaming Star 8x10&#39; B&W Publicity Lobby Photo Dolores Del Rio #81 Kiowa Indian Village Western Film",
"description": "A rare 1960 original movie still from &quot;Flaming Star&quot;! Elvis with attitude watching Dolores Del Rio & a Kiowa Indian woman. Photo #81. These photos are beautifully printed, sharp images that cannot be reproduced in MY photos! Please note that these are original, studio issued photos, not reprints. \n\nAfter his first 5 movies, Elvis wanted to play a serious dramatic role. This was it. It is generally considered to be one of his 2 best films (the other being King Creole). The New York Times film critic called it &quot;an unpretentious, sturdy Western that takes the time period, the place, & the people seriously. It&#39;s a neat & satisfying adventure.&quot; \n\nThe movie was directed by Don Siegel, written by Clair Huffaker & Nunnally Johnson, & costarred the lovely Dolores Del Rio, Barbara Eden, John McIntire, & Steve Forrest. Originally, Marlon Brando & Frank Sinatra were signed to play the roles of the brothers.\n\nPublicity stills of Elvis from this movie were used by Andy Warhol to create several iconic silkscreens. A copy of his &quot;Double Elvis&quot; sold for $37 million in 2013, & a &quot;Triple Elvis&quot; sold for $82 million last year.\n\nDESCRIPTION & CONDITION:\nThis publicity still measures 8 x 10&quot;. Its condition is Very Good to Fine with only very minor issues typical of photos of this age & that do not distract. There is a tiny tear (less than 1/4&quot;) & crease at the top left corner in the margin & a few pinholes in the margins. It has only a few creases & ripples, much less than normal for a photo this age. Please see all photos with zoom.\n\nIf you would like to see more photos, please convo.\n\nVisit my shop for more great Elvis collectibles:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/vintagewordandimage/search?search_query=elvis\n\nPacked with care: sealed in an acid-free archival poly bag, sandwiched between cardboard sheets & shipped in a cardboard mailer by USPS Priority Mail, including tracking & insurance. Each extra movie still or art print ships FREE, so browse around my shop! Www.etsy.com/shop/vintagewordandimage\n\nInternational buyers please inquire if your country isn&#39;t listed in the shipping details. \n\nFor 100&#39;s of great antique & vintage art prints from around the world: www.etsy.com/shop/exoticimages\n\nThank you for stopping by! Please mark my shop as a Favorite & visit often as I continue to list great vintage books, magazines, art prints & movie memorabilia!",

"description": "A vintage map of Memphis, TN.\n\nAt checkout, you can choose between pendant only, pendant with chain, or key chain with swivel hook (see picture 2 above).\n\nCHAIN OPTIONS:  The pretty little cross-link chain shown in pictures 1 and 3 above is available in 6 different lengths (16&quot;, 18&quot;, 21&quot;, 24&quot;, 27&quot; and 30&quot;) and you can choose your length at checkout.  \n\nIf you would prefer a snake chain or a ball chain, both are available in the shop section below:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/thependantemporium?section_id=7125216&ref=shopsection_leftnav_10\n\nShipping an additional item is only 25 cents, so be sure to add the ball or snake chain to your cart before checking out with your pendant.\n\nThe handcrafted pendant measures 27 mm across (1.06 inch), and its artwork or map is covered with high gloss epoxy resin which both protects and enhances the image. The keychain has a 30 mm (1.18 inch) key ring and a convenient swivel hook clasp. \n\nEach necklace or key ring will come in its own pretty little gauze gift bag, ready for gift-giving.  If you&#39;re purchasing several pendants without chains, we usually place two to three pendants in each little gift bag, but packing one pendant per bag is never a problem, just please let us know how many gift bags you need.\n\nPendants are water resistant but not completely waterproof, please remove to swim or shower. NOT INTENDED FOR SMALL CHILDREN.\n\nPlease visit The Pendant Emporium on Etsy for many more unique and beautiful pendant designs: \n\nhttp://www.thependantemporium.etsy.com.",

"policy_additional": "Vinyl Record Grading\r\n\r\n**Mint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\n\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop.\r\n\r\nOther Considerations\r\n\r\nA separate grade is assigned to the record and it&#39;s sleeve or cover. In each listing, a record&#39;s grade is listed first, followed by that of the sleeve or the cover.",

"announcement": "Welcome to my vintage shop on Etsy!  Relive your childhood-come on in and browse!  :) \r\n\r\nThis is my story:\r\nOur older home has fueled a passion for me to collect vintage items!  What started off as a hobby has turned into an outright passion!  I LOOOVE what I do! Every vintage item has a past - a story behind it - and that intrigues me.....all my shop items have stood the test of time!  :)  Vintage items are simply better quality and last longer than products made now.  My husband has gently encouraged me to share some of these vintage items with the world, :) - not to hoard them all,  :) - thus the birth of my shop!  :)  Plus, now I can work from home and enjoy the children that God has given me!  :)\r\n\r\nI take all photos on our vintage kitchen table.....I am not a professional photographer by any means, but I strive to do my best!   :-)  Photo taking has become a family affair......my girls help by arranging the items on our kitchen table.....and lately one daughter has even started to take some pictures!  :)\r\n\r\nI am finding great joy in uniting people with items they treasure from the past!  :)   Let me do the hunting for you!   :)  We support our local Goodwill and Salvation Army stores.....so when you buy from my shop, not only do you help our family, you help countless others by supporting these not for profit charity stores that help people get back on their feet again.  SO THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something specific, please feel free to contact me - I love being on the lookout for items.....adds to the thrill of the hunt!  And who knows, I actually may already have what you are looking for - just haven&#39;t got around to listing it yet!  It has happened!  :)\r\n\r\nPlease check me out on Pinterest - Kress Hill Vintage - I have many boards and you can see my personal growing Melmac collection (it does seem to be multiplying on its own!).  BTW, for you Melmac lovers, I have lots more Melmac to be listed.....plus I am growing very fond of vintage ads.....\r\n\r\nFor your information, we live in a non-smoking home.  If I purchase an item from an estate sale where there was a smoker, I will be sure to pass that information on to you in the listing.\r\n\r\nI have an eclectic style - you never know what you will find in my store!  I&#39;m always adding new items - (i have PLENTY to add!) - so please check back often!  I try to grow my shop every day!  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!   :)\r\n\r\nQuestions?

"policy_shipping": "I ship worldwide - Canada Post in most cases (please convo if regular mail is fine or if you require insurance/tracking).  The rates quoted are estimates by regular mail only - insurance and tracking would likely be extra.  If you require faster delivery, please convo me. \r\n\r\nI am always thrilled to combine shipping costs - just convo me for a quote!  :)\r\n\r\nShipping costs are based on the weight of the item, packaging needs and destination.  I try to keep costs as low as possible.  It is very difficult to estimate shipping costs as they vary greatly from province to province, state to state and worldwide!  For final shipping costs, please contact me prior to making payment.  The shipping costs could indeed be well below the shipping estimates listed.  I do not make a profit on shipping, so if actual shipping costs are lower than estimated, I will refund the difference IMMEDIATELY.  Shipment is within 1-3 business days after payment has cleared.  In many instances I spend my time making boxes smaller to fit purchased items - to reduce your shipping costs as much as possible.   :)  I would rather you keep more money in your pocket than donate to Canada Post!  :)\r\n\r\nYour package will be sent to the address on your Etsy account - please ensure it is current!  Insurance is recommended on breakable items. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - it is best to convo me for a shipping quote and state if you would like tracking and/or insurance. Taxes and fees for packages to enter buyer&#39;s country is the responsibility of the buyer.  Please be aware that it can take several weeks to receive your purchase, especially if sent by regular mail (ground).  For some countries, it can take as long as six to eight weeks!  You can request air mail, which would cost a little extra, then the estimated delivery time would be two-three weeks.  Expedited service, with tracking and insurance, is always an option, but please note it is very costly to send a parcel this way!\r\n\r\nI take great care packaging your items; however, I cannot control what happens to the package once it leaves my hands - so no refunds are given on damaged, lost or stolen packages.  If this is a concern, tracking and insurance  is recommended - advise you desire this when contacting for a shipping quote.  Your understanding is greatly appreciated.  :)\r\n\r\nI will notify you when your package has been shipped.\r\n\r\nAny questions - please convo!  :)",
"policy_refunds": "Customer satisfaction is the name of the game!  :) \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind all items are gently used vintage items and in &quot;as is&quot; condition.  I take great care and do my heartfelt best to describe all items in detail.   I note any and all &quot;defects&quot; or &quot;faults&quot; as I see them.  I want my customers to purchase with full knowledge and confidence that what they are purchasing is EXACTLY what is pictured and described!  :-)\r\n\r\nI want you to be delighted with your purchase, but if you don&#39;t love it, I do accept returns.  Please contact me within 48 hours of receipt of your purchase.  A returned item should be in the same condition as when it left my hands (please carefully repackage!), and sent back in its original packaging, with all postage costs paid by the buyer.  \r\n\r\nI am pretty easy to get along with, really!  :-)\r\n\r\nBottom line - I want you to be happy!  :)  ",

I am happy to combine shipping on multiple orders.  Please convo me at the time of purchase if you have specific shipping requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinyl Record Grading Guide:\r\n**Mint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\n\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more unique vintage items please visit my store:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/KressHillVintage",

"announcement": "Welcome to my vintage shop on Etsy!  Relive your childhood-come on in and browse!  :) \r\n\r\nThis is my story:\r\nOur older home has fueled a passion for me to collect vintage items!  What started off as a hobby has turned into an outright passion!  I LOOOVE what I do! Every vintage item has a past - a story behind it - and that intrigues me.....all my shop items have stood the test of time!  :)  Vintage items are simply better quality and last longer than products made now.  My husband has gently encouraged me to share some of these vintage items with the world, :) - not to hoard them all,  :) - thus the birth of my shop!  :)  Plus, now I can work from home and enjoy the children that God has given me!  :)\r\n\r\nI take all photos on our vintage kitchen table.....I am not a professional photographer by any means, but I strive to do my best!   :-)  Photo taking has become a family affair......my girls help by arranging the items on our kitchen table.....and lately one daughter has even started to take some pictures!  :)\r\n\r\nI am finding great joy in uniting people with items they treasure from the past!  :)   Let me do the hunting for you!   :)  We support our local Goodwill and Salvation Army stores.....so when you buy from my shop, not only do you help our family, you help countless others by supporting these not for profit charity stores that help people get back on their feet again.  SO THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something specific, please feel free to contact me - I love being on the lookout for items.....adds to the thrill of the hunt!  And who knows, I actually may already have what you are looking for - just haven&#39;t got around to listing it yet!  It has happened!  :)\r\n\r\nPlease check me out on Pinterest - Kress Hill Vintage - I have many boards and you can see my personal growing Melmac collection (it does seem to be multiplying on its own!).  BTW, for you Melmac lovers, I have lots more Melmac to be listed.....plus I am growing very fond of vintage ads.....\r\n\r\nFor your information, we live in a non-smoking home.  If I purchase an item from an estate sale where there was a smoker, I will be sure to pass that information on to you in the listing.\r\n\r\nI have an eclectic style - you never know what you will find in my store!  I&#39;m always adding new items - (i have PLENTY to add!) - so please check back often!  I try to grow my shop every day!  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!   :)\r\n\r\nQuestions?  Convo me for a quick reply!",

"policy_payment": "We accept PayPal, all major credit cards, money orders and Etsy gift cards.  I can also put items on layaway.  We are a registered business in the province of Ontario and thus must collect tax from our Canadian customers.  ",
"policy_shipping": "I ship worldwide - Canada Post in most cases (please convo if regular mail is fine or if you require insurance/tracking).  The rates quoted are estimates by regular mail only - insurance and tracking would likely be extra.  If you require faster delivery, please convo me. \r\n\r\nI am always thrilled to combine shipping costs - just convo me for a quote!  :)\r\n\r\nShipping costs are based on the weight of the item, packaging needs and destination.  I try to keep costs as low as possible.  It is very difficult to estimate shipping costs as they vary greatly from province to province, state to state and worldwide!  For final shipping costs, please contact me prior to making payment.  The shipping costs could indeed be well below the shipping estimates listed.  I do not make a profit on shipping, so if actual shipping costs are lower than estimated, I will refund the difference IMMEDIATELY.  Shipment is within 1-3 business days after payment has cleared.  In many instances I spend my time making boxes smaller to fit purchased items - to reduce your shipping costs as much as possible.   :)  I would rather you keep more money in your pocket than donate to Canada Post!  :)\r\n\r\nYour package will be sent to the address on your Etsy account - please ensure it is current!  Insurance is recommended on breakable items. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - it is best to convo me for a shipping quote and state if you would like tracking and/or insurance. Taxes and fees for packages to enter buyer&#39;s country is the responsibility of the buyer.  Please be aware that it can take several weeks to receive your purchase, especially if sent by regular mail (ground).  For some countries, it can take as long as six to eight weeks!  You can request air mail, which would cost a little extra, then the estimated delivery time would be two-three weeks.  Expedited service, with tracking and insurance, is always an option, but please note it is very costly to send a parcel this way!\r\n\r\nI take great care packaging your items; however, I cannot control what happens to the package once it leaves my hands - so no refunds are given on damaged, lost or stolen packages.  If this is a concern, tracking and insurance  is recommended - advise you desire this when contacting for a shipping quote.  Your understanding is greatly appreciated.  :)\r\n\r\nI will notify you when your package has been shipped.\r\n\r\nAny questions - please convo!  :)",
"policy_refunds": "Customer satisfaction is the name of the game!  :) \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind all items are gently used vintage items and in &quot;as is&quot; condition.  I take great care and do my heartfelt best to describe all items in detail.   I note any and all &quot;defects&quot; or &quot;faults&quot; as I see them.  I want my customers to purchase with full knowledge and confidence that what they are purchasing is EXACTLY what is pictured and described!  :-)\r\n\r\nI want you to be delighted with your purchase, but if you don&#39;t love it, I do accept returns.  Please contact me within 48 hours of receipt of your purchase.  A returned item should be in the same condition as when it left my hands (please carefully repackage!), and sent back in its original packaging, with all postage costs paid by the buyer.  \r\n\r\nI am pretty easy to get along with, really!  :-)\r\n\r\nBottom line - I want you to be happy!  :)  ",

"description": "ARTIST:  Elvis Presley\r\nALBUM TITLE:  See Elvis In Hal Willis&#39; Blue Hawaii\r\nYEAR:  1961\r\nLABEL: RCA Victor\r\nCOUNTRY:  Canada\r\nCODE: LPM-2426\r\nDURATION: LP\r\nRECORD SIZE: 12 inch\r\nSPEED: 33 rpm\r\n\r\nCOVER CONDITION:  VG\r\nRECORD CONDITION:  VG-\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTINGS:\r\nSIDE 1:  Blue Hawaii, Almost Always True, Aloha Oe, No More, Can&#39;t Help Falling In Love, Rock-A-Hula Baby, Moonlight Swim\r\nSIDE 2: Ku-u-I-po, Ito Eats, Slicin&#39; Sand, Hawaiian Sunset, Beach Boy Blues, Island of Love, Hawaiian Wedding Song\r\n\r\nPlease note on the back cover, left hand side, someone wrote their name in ink. \r\n\r\nAll items are used (unless noted) and are sold as-is.  I try to do my very best to grade each album using the grading guide included below.  Please convo me if you have any specific questions regarding an item’s condition.\r\n\r\nI ship all items as quickly and carefully as possible in boxes specifically designed for vinyl records.  I am happy to combine shipping on multiple orders.  Please convo me at the time of purchase if you have specific shipping requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinyl Record Grading Guide:\r\n**Mint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more unique vintage items please visit my store:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/KressHillVintage",

"announcement": "Welcome to my vintage shop on Etsy!  Relive your childhood-come on in and browse!  :) \r\n\r\nThis is my story:\r\nOur older home has fueled a passion for me to collect vintage items!  What started off as a hobby has turned into an outright passion!  I LOOOVE what I do! Every vintage item has a past - a story behind it - and that intrigues me.....all my shop items have stood the test of time!  :)  Vintage items are simply better quality and last longer than products made now.  My husband has gently encouraged me to share some of these vintage items with the world, :) - not to hoard them all,  :) - thus the birth of my shop!  :)  Plus, now I can work from home and enjoy the children that God has given me!  :)\r\n\r\nI take all photos on our vintage kitchen table.....I am not a professional photographer by any means, but I strive to do my best!   :-)  Photo taking has become a family affair......my girls help by arranging the items on our kitchen table.....and lately one daughter has even started to take some pictures!  :)\r\n\r\nI am finding great joy in uniting people with items they treasure from the past!  :)   Let me do the hunting for you!   :)  We support our local Goodwill and Salvation Army stores.....so when you buy from my shop, not only do you help our family, you help countless others by supporting these not for profit charity stores that help people get back on their feet again.  SO THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something specific, please feel free to contact me - I love being on the lookout for items.....adds to the thrill of the hunt!  And who knows, I actually may already have what you are looking for - just haven&#39;t got around to listing it yet!  It has happened!  :)\r\n\r\nPlease check me out on Pinterest - Kress Hill Vintage - I have many boards and you can see my personal growing Melmac collection (it does seem to be multiplying on its own!).  BTW, for you Melmac lovers, I have lots more Melmac to be listed.....plus I am growing very fond of vintage ads.....\r\n\r\nFor your information, we live in a non-smoking home.  If I purchase an item from an estate sale where there was a smoker, I will be sure to pass that information on to you in the listing.\r\n\r\nI have an eclectic style - you never know what you will find in my store!  I&#39;m always adding new items - (i have PLENTY to add!) - so please check back often!  I try to grow my shop every day!  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!   :)\r\n\r\nQuestions?

I do not make a profit on shipping, so if actual shipping costs are lower than estimated, I will refund the difference IMMEDIATELY.  Shipment is within 1-3 business days after payment has cleared.

Insurance is recommended on breakable items. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - it is best to convo me for a shipping quote and state if you would like tracking and/or insurance. Taxes and fees for packages to enter buyer&#39;s country is the responsibility of the buyer.  Please be aware that it can take several weeks to receive your purchase, especially if sent by regular mail (ground).  For some countries, it can take as long as six to eight weeks!  You can request air mail, which would cost a little extra, then the estimated delivery time would be two-three weeks.  Expedited service, with tracking and insurance, is always an option, but please note it is very costly to send a parcel this way!\r\n\r\nI take great care packaging your items; however, I cannot control what happens to the package once it leaves my hands - so no refunds are given on damaged, lost or stolen packages.  If this is a concern, tracking and insurance  is recommended - advise you desire this when contacting for a shipping quote.

"description": "ARTIST:  Elvis Presley\r\nALBUM TITLE:  Elvis - I Got Lucky  \r\nYEAR:  1971\r\nLABEL:  Pickwick\r\nCOUNTRY:  United States \r\nCODE: CAS-2533\r\nDURATION: LP\r\nRECORD SIZE: 12 inch \r\nSPEED: 33 rpm\r\n\r\nCOVER CONDITION:   NM\r\nRECORD CONDITION:  VG\r\nSLEEVE CONDITION:  VG+\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTINGS:\r\nSIDE 1: I Got Lucky, What a Wonderful Life, I Need Somebody To Lean On, Yoga Is As Yoga Does, Riding the Rainbow\r\nSIDE 2:  Fools Fall In Love, The Love Machine, Home Is Where The Heart Is, You Gotta Stop, If You Think I Don&#39;t Need You\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise requested, this item will be mailed with tracking and insurance within Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - please convo for a shipping quote - and if you would like the item to be sent with tracking and insurance OR regular mail.\r\n\r\nAll items are used (unless noted) and are sold as-is.  I try to do my very best to grade each album using the grading guide included below.  Please convo me if you have any specific questions regarding an item’s condition.\r\n\r\nI ship all items as quickly and carefully as possible in boxes specifically designed for vinyl records.  I am happy to combine shipping on multiple orders.  Please convo me at the time of purchase if you have specific shipping requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinyl Record Grading Guide:\r\n**Mint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\n\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more unique vintage items please visit my store:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/KressHillVintage",

Goode, And I Love You So\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise requested, this item will be mailed with tracking and insurance within Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - please convo for a shipping quote - and if you would like the item to be sent with tracking and insurance OR regular mail.\r\n\r\nAll items are used (unless noted) and are sold as-is.  I try to do my very best to grade each album using the grading guide included below.  Please convo me if you have any specific questions regarding an item’s condition.\r\n\r\nI ship all items as quickly and carefully as possible in boxes specifically designed for vinyl records.  I am happy to combine shipping on multiple orders.  Please convo me at the time of purchase if you have specific shipping requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinyl Record Grading Guide:\r\n**Mint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\n\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more unique vintage items please visit my store:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/KressHillVintage",

"announcement": "Welcome to my vintage shop on Etsy!  Relive your childhood-come on in and browse!  :) \r\n\r\nThis is my story:\r\nOur older home has fueled a passion for me to collect vintage items!  What started off as a hobby has turned into an outright passion!  I LOOOVE what I do! Every vintage item has a past - a story behind it - and that intrigues me.....all my shop items have stood the test of time!  :)  Vintage items are simply better quality and last longer than products made now.  My husband has gently encouraged me to share some of these vintage items with the world, :) - not to hoard them all,  :) - thus the birth of my shop!  :)  Plus, now I can work from home and enjoy the children that God has given me!  :)\r\n\r\nI take all photos on our vintage kitchen table.....I am not a professional photographer by any means, but I strive to do my best!   :-)  Photo taking has become a family affair......my girls help by arranging the items on our kitchen table.....and lately one daughter has even started to take some pictures!  :)\r\n\r\nI am finding great joy in uniting people with items they treasure from the past!  :)   Let me do the hunting for you!   :)  We support our local Goodwill and Salvation Army stores.....so when you buy from my shop, not only do you help our family, you help countless others by supporting these not for profit charity stores that help people get back on their feet again.  SO THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something specific, please feel free to contact me - I love being on the lookout for items.....adds to the thrill of the hunt!  And who knows, I actually may already have what you are looking for - just haven&#39;t got around to listing it yet!  It has happened!  :)\r\n\r\nPlease check me out on Pinterest - Kress Hill Vintage - I have many boards and you can see my personal growing Melmac collection (it does seem to be multiplying on its own!).  BTW, for you Melmac lovers, I have lots more Melmac to be listed.....plus I am growing very fond of vintage ads.....\r\n\r\nFor your information, we live in a non-smoking home.  If I purchase an item from an estate sale where there was a smoker, I will be sure to pass that information on to you in the listing.\r\n\r\nI have an eclectic style - you never know what you will find in my store!  I&#39;m always adding new items - (i have PLENTY to add!) - so please check back often!  I try to grow my shop every day!  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!   :)\r\n\r\nQuestions?  Convo me for a quick reply!",

"policy_payment": "We accept PayPal, all major credit cards, money orders and Etsy gift cards.  I can also put items on layaway.  We are a registered business in the province of Ontario and thus must collect tax from our Canadian customers.  ",
"policy_shipping": "I ship worldwide - Canada Post in most cases (please convo if regular mail is fine or if you require insurance/tracking).  The rates quoted are estimates by regular mail only - insurance and tracking would likely be extra.  If you require faster delivery, please convo me. \r\n\r\nI am always thrilled to combine shipping costs - just convo me for a quote!  :)\r\n\r\nShipping costs are based on the weight of the item, packaging needs and destination.  I try to keep costs as low as possible.  It is very difficult to estimate shipping costs as they vary greatly from province to province, state to state and worldwide!  For final shipping costs, please contact me prior to making payment.  The shipping costs could indeed be well below the shipping estimates listed.  I do not make a profit on shipping, so if actual shipping costs are lower than estimated, I will refund the difference IMMEDIATELY.  Shipment is within 1-3 business days after payment has cleared.  In many instances I spend my time making boxes smaller to fit purchased items - to reduce your shipping costs as much as possible.   :)  I would rather you keep more money in your pocket than donate to Canada Post!  :)\r\n\r\nYour package will be sent to the address on your Etsy account - please ensure it is current!  Insurance is recommended on breakable items. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS - it is best to convo me for a shipping quote and state if you would like tracking and/or insurance. Taxes and fees for packages to enter buyer&#39;s country is the responsibility of the buyer.  Please be aware that it can take several weeks to receive your purchase, especially if sent by regular mail (ground).  For some countries, it can take as long as six to eight weeks!  You can request air mail, which would cost a little extra, then the estimated delivery time would be two-three weeks.  Expedited service, with tracking and insurance, is always an option, but please note it is very costly to send a parcel this way!\r\n\r\nI take great care packaging your items; however, I cannot control what happens to the package once it leaves my hands - so no refunds are given on damaged, lost or stolen packages.  If this is a concern, tracking and insurance  is recommended - advise you desire this when contacting for a shipping quote.  Your understanding is greatly appreciated.  :)\r\n\r\nI will notify you when your package has been shipped.\r\n\r\nAny questions - please convo!  :)",
"policy_refunds": "Customer satisfaction is the name of the game!  :) \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind all items are gently used vintage items and in &quot;as is&quot; condition.  I take great care and do my heartfelt best to describe all items in detail.   I note any and all &quot;defects&quot; or &quot;faults&quot; as I see them.  I want my customers to purchase with full knowledge and confidence that what they are purchasing is EXACTLY what is pictured and described!  :-)\r\n\r\nI want you to be delighted with your purchase, but if you don&#39;t love it, I do accept returns.  Please contact me within 48 hours of receipt of your purchase.  A returned item should be in the same condition as when it left my hands (please carefully repackage!), and sent back in its original packaging, with all postage costs paid by the buyer.  \r\n\r\nI am pretty easy to get along with, really!  :-)\r\n\r\nBottom line - I want you to be happy!  :)  ",

This listing is for a bundle of 10, your choice with free USPS Priority Shipping in the U.S. or free USPS First Class shipping to everywhere else. \r\n\r\nAdd your selections in the box that says &quot;Notes to ReImagination Prints&quot; when you check out. \r\n\r\nThese antique dictionary pages are from an 1897 English language dictionary. The actual printed page you will receive will be selected from the same antique dictionary. Each print is one of a kind. Keep in mind that these dictionary pages are over 115 years old so there will be some slight variation in the color from page to page.\r\n\r\nPage size approximately 8x11 (20.32 cm x 27.94 cm) with slight variations. I especially like to work with this particular antique dictionary because the page size is so versatile. Very easy to frame! The top and bottom of the page have generous margins so of course you can trim or mat them to fit nearly any size frame you like. \r\n\r\nFrame not included, you will receive just the prints.\r\n\r\n*Buy 2, get 1 free does not apply to this listing.
